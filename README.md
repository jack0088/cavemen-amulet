*Smugglers* is a stupid tetris-like game prototype.

Imagine that you're a refugee smuggler.
Fill up a boat as good as you can and send it off to the sea.
Avoid helping terrorists but save others.

**Quick note:** This game is a private doodle and far from being finished. Work just began, so do not look around here :p
